Hello and welcome! My goal for this project is to create an ios app in swift that can easily and effectively 

-track time on the go
-save into a file (.xclx prefered)
-email said file at end of week

I know very little about programming, and github. This is my attempt to learn as i go.
I'd also like to see this timeCell app grow and merge with other apps.
Thank you for any help and contributions!
